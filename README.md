- 👋 Hi, I’m Alex, in March of 2021 I googled "Ethereum" for the first time. Prior to this I'd consider myself strictly an end-user of anything on the computer. After spending a couple weeks reading through ethereum.org I fell in love and got lost. I've since built my own computer from components and completed over 100 hours of coding tutorials. My end goal is to be able to contribute as a developer to open source public goods projects.
